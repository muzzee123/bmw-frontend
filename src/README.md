Angular Frontend App.

I used node and angular version 9 to build this project.
this is the front end to view the bmw backend.

Requirements For building and running the application you need:

node is needed to run npm commands, I used node 12
angular cli => 9

The back must be running in order to access the service.

1. download the source code to your local machine.
2. go to the root of the project and run npm install to download dependencies.
3. use npm start to run the project or ng serve
4. access the project on localhost:5000/cars to view list of cars.

note: I added a login and register page, it does not feel right to write a front end without those, 
if it was not needed apologies, so please register your login credentials at first and then login so you can access the list.

more: I would have added CRUD functions (update, delete and create) if I had more time, but those are already in place in the back end
it's just a matter of calling them from the front end.

Hope all is in order.
