# BmwFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


Requirements For building and running the application you need:

node is needed to run npm commands, I used node 12
angular cli => 9

The back must be running in order to access the service.

1. download the source code to your local machine.
2. go to the root of the project and run npm install to download dependencies.
3. use npm start to run the project or ng serve
4. access the project on localhost:5000/cars to view list of cars.

note: I added a login and register page, it does not feel right to write a front end without those, 
if it was not needed apologies, so please register your login credentials at first and then login so you can access the list.

more: I would have added CRUD functions (update, delete and create) if I had more time, but those are already in place in the back end
it's just a matter of calling them from the front end.

Hope all is in order.
